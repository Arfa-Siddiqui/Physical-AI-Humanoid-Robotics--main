## Final Thoughts

Physical AI is at an inflection point—foundation models trained on internet-scale data are now grounding their knowledge in physical action. The next generation of humanoid robots will not be programmed task-by-task but will generalize from demonstrations and language, transforming industries from manufacturing to healthcare.

You now possess the technical foundation to contribute to this transformation. Whether you're building research prototypes, deploying industrial systems, or pushing the boundaries of what's possible, remember: **the future of robotics is embodied, intelligent, and waiting for you to build it.**

Welcome to Physical AI. Let's build the future together.
